      Natlan, and Snezhnaya, each ruled by a god.[â€¡ 1] The mysterious floating

      arrive in the land of Teyvat, but find that the nation of Khaenri'ah is
      under cataclysmic siege. Attempting to leave to avoid the carnage, the
      twins are separated by an unknown god, who takes one and seals away the
